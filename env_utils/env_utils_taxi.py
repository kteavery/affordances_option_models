r"""Utilities to make it easier to work with the taxi environment.

The full description of the environment can be found here
https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v2/. The general idea is that the environment
is a 5x5 grid world with 4 goal locations (represented by `Colors`). The taxi
can be in any of the 25 states in the world. The passenger can be in one of
the four goal positions or inside the taxi. The destination represents which
goal position the passenger needs to be in at the end of the episode. The agent
controls the taxi and gets +20 for dropping the passenger to the correct goal.
The agent gets -10 if it drops the passenger to the wrong goal. The agent gets
-1 for each step of the episode.
