  r"""Prepares the trajectory data ready for tensorflow.

  This function unpacks transition data and stacks them suitable for input
  to a neural network. The idea is:
  1. Convert the transition tuples into lists containing the entries of the
     tuples.
  2. Stack the elements for tensorflow and reshape the lists so that they are
     of shape (batch_size, 1). Note: That if the transition contains a tuple,
     it will be flattened such that the shape will be (None, 1).

  Args:
    data: A list of tuples with the transition data.

  Returns:
    A list of `tf.Tensor`s that are suitable for a neural network.
